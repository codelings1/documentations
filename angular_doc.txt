Angular

1.
-Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications.
-To generate new components we use the below command
ng generate component heroes 
This generates the component named heroes and adds 3 important files to a directory heroes
		-heroes.component.css	//specify related css here
		-heroes.component.html	//specify related html here
		-heroes.component.ts	//this file creates the class and mentions the html and css associations
		
-You always import the Component symbol from the Angular core library and annotate the component class with @Component.

-@Component is a decorator function that specifies the Angular metadata for the component.

-The CLI generated three metadata properties:

	-selector— the component's CSS element selector
	-templateUrl— the location of the component's template file.
	-styleUrls— the location of the component's private CSS styles.
	
-The CSS element selector, 'app-heroes', matches the name of the HTML element that identifies this component within a parent component's template.

-The ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook Angular calls ngOnInit shortly after creating a component. It's a good place to put initialization logic.

-Always export the component class so you can import it elsewhere ... like in the AppModule.
